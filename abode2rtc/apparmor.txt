    # 1. Add what is obviously needed based on what is in the script
    # 2. Add `complain` as a flag to this profile temporarily and run the addon
    # 3. Review the audit log with `journalctl _TRANSPORT="audit" -g 'apparmor="ALLOWED"'` and add other access as needed
    # Remember to remove the `complain` flag when you are done
